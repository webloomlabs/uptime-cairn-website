/**
 * Copies documentation, the OpenAPI spec, and the product screenshots out of
 * the Uptime Cairn repository into this one.
 *
 * Why copies rather than reading the sibling checkout at build time: Vercel
 * clones one repository, so `../uptime-cairn` does not exist in the build
 * container. A submodule would work but drags an entire Go repo into every
 * build for five markdown files, and makes a website-only correction require a
 * commit in the product repo.
 *
 * The markdown is copied byte for byte. That is deliberate — `--check` is then
 * a plain buffer comparison, which is the whole anti-drift mechanism. Nothing
 * is rewritten on the way in; the rendering pipeline does all of that at build
 * time from the untouched source.
 *
 *   npm run sync:docs          copy, and rewrite the version constants
 *   npm run sync:docs:check    exit non-zero if anything has drifted
 *
 * Run the check on a schedule rather than in `build` — a stale doc must never
 * block a deploy of an unrelated change.
