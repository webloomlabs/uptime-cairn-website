/**
 * The /docs/api page.
 *
 * Hand-written rather than rendered from markdown, because the generated
 * reference is 140 operations long and belongs beside the spec rather than on
 * a website. What is here is the part a specification cannot state: the rules
 * a client author needs to know before reading any of it.
 *
 * Every claim is drawn from docs/api/README.md in the product repo, which
 * scripts/sync-docs.ts copies into content/docs/api/README.md — so an upstream
 * change to the conventions shows up as a diff here and this file can be
 * brought back in line.
