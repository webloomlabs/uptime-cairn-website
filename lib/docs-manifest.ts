/**
 * The single source of truth for the docs section.
 *
 * The source markdown lives in the product repo and is copied here byte for
 * byte (see scripts/sync-docs.ts), which means it carries no frontmatter and
 * never will — the moment a copy stops matching its source, the drift check
 * that keeps this content honest stops working. So everything the markdown
 * does not say lives here instead: routes, order, grouping, page titles, and
 * the descriptions used for search results and meta tags.
 *
 * Ordering is array order. Grouping is the array an entry is in. Nothing is
 * derived from a filename.
 *
 * This module also drives the sidebar, the pager, the sitemap, the footer's
 * documentation column, the landing page's docs teaser, and the link rewriter
 * — so a page cannot appear in one of those and be missing from another.
